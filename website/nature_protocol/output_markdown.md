Our pipeline follows the GTEx pipeline from the [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/aboutGTEx#staticTextAnalysisMethods)/[TOPMed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md) project for the quantification of expression from RNA-seq data. Either paired end or single end fastq.gz files may be used as the initial input. Different read [strandedness options](https://rnabio.org/module-09-appendix/0009/12/01/StrandSettings/) are possible, including rf, fr, unstranded or strand_missing, based on library types from Signal et al [[cf. Signal et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-022-04572-7)]. Strand detection steps are included in this pipeline to automaticaly detect the strand of the input fastq file by levradging the gene count table ouptut from [STAR](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf). Read length data is required and is set to a default value of 100 for reads of zero length. 



We recommend using fastqc to quality control reads, followed by the removal of adaptors with fastp if necessary. After quality control has been conducted, STAR may be used to align reads to the reference genome. We combine this mapping step with an additionaly quality control step using Picard to mark duplicate reads and collect other metrics. 



Gene-level RNA expression is called with RNA-SeQC v2.4.2 using a reference gtf that has been collapsed to contain genes instead of gene transcripts [[cf. DeLuca et al., Bioinformatics, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts196)]. Reads are only included if they are uniquely mapped (mapping quality of 255 for STAR BAMs), if they are aligned in proper pairs, if the read alignment distance was less than or equal to six (i.e. alignments must not contain more than six non-reference bases), and if they are fully contained within exon boundaries. Reads overlapping introns are not included. Exon level read counts are also called by RNA-SeQC. If a read overlaps multiple exons, then a fractional value equal to the portion of the read contained within the exon is allotted. We call transcript-level RNA expression using RSEM v1.3.0 with a transcript reference gtf. 

Quality control of the TPM matrices follows methods outlined by [GTEx V8](https://gtexportal.org/home/aboutGTEx#staticTextAnalysisMethods). First, genes are removed from the matrices if over 20% of samples have have a TPM expression level of 10% or less. Sample level filtering includes three checks to detect sample outliers. Samples are only removed if they are marked as outliers in all three checks. 



The first looks at Relative Log Expression (RLE). It is assumed that most gene expression values in a sample should be near a mean value and only a few genes are differentially expressed. To calculate RLE, for each gene *i*, calculate its median in *N* samples as *Medi*. Then for each sample *j* and expression value *eij*, count the difference between *eij* and *Medi* (*deij = eij-Medi*). Then create boxplots for each sample based on *deij* and sort by interquartile range. Samples with larger interquartile ranges are more likely to be outliers. 



The second quality control check looks at heirarchical clustering of samples. Samples are expected to have short distances between others and therefore should cluster homogeneously, so distant samples are expected to be outliers. Distance is calculated as 1-spearman correlation for heirarchical clustering. The top 100 genes sorted by variance are used to calculate Mahalanobis distance. Chi2 p-values are then calculated based on Mahalanobis distance. Clusters with 60% or more samples with Bonferroni corrected p-values less than 0.05 are marked as outliers. 



The third and last quality control check looks at D-statistics which represent the average correlation between a sample's expression and other sampels. Samples with low D-statistics are likely to be outliers. 









The normalization step follows steps used by the GTeX pipeline. Genes are first filtered to keep genes where TPM is greater than 10% in at least 20% of the samples. They are also kept if read counts is greater than 6 in at least 20% of the samples. The filtered data is then normalized using the Trimmed Mean of M-value (TMM) method. 



##### B.  Alternative splicing from RNA-seq data


Our pipeline calls alternative splicing events from RNA-seq data using leafcutter and psichomics to call the RNA-seq data from `fastq.gz` data which has been mapped to a reference genome using STAR with the wasp option. It implements the GTEx pipeline for GTEx/TOPMed project. Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md) for detail. The choice of pipeline modules in this project is supported by internal (unpublished) benchmarks from GTEx group.



We use two different tools to quantify the many types of splicing events which are outlined in [[cf. Wang et al (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature07509)] and [[cf. Park et al (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.11.002)]. The first, leafcutter, quantifies the usage of alternatively excised introns. This collectively captures skipped exons, 5’ and 3’ alternative splice site usage and other complex events [[cf. Li et al 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-017-0004-9)]. This method was previously applied to ROSMAP data as part of the Brain xQTL version 2.0.  The second, psichomics, quantifies specific splicing events [[cf. Agostinho et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky888)].


Quality control and normalization are performed on output from the leafcutter and psichomics tools. The raw output data is first converted to bed format. Quality control involves the removal of features with high missingness across samples (default 40%) and any remaining missing values are retained. Then introns with less than a minimal variation (default of 0.005) are removed from the data. Quantile-Quantile normalization is performed on the quality controlled data. Imputation of missing values is done separately afterwards. 
#### Data Pre-processing (Step 3)
##### A.  Phenotype data preprocessing


We use a gene coordinate annotation pipeline based on [`pyqtl`, as demonstrated here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/qtl/src/eqtl_prepare_expression.py). This adds genomic coordinate annotations to gene-level molecular phenotype files generated in `gct` format and converts them to `bed` format for downstreams analysis.


We include a collection of workflows to format molecular phenotype data. These include workflows to separate phenotypes by chromosome, by user-provided regions, a workflow to subset bam files and a workflow to extract samples from phenotype files.

##### B.  Covariate Data Preprocessing


Our covariate preprocessing steps merge genotypic principal components and fixed covariate files into one file for downstream QTL analysis. 

We provide two different procedures for hidden factor analysis from omics data in our pipeline. The first is the [Probabilistic Estimation of Expression Residuals (PEER) method](https://github.com/PMBio/peer/wiki/Tutorial), a method also used for GTEx eQTL data analysis. The second, and the one use for our main analyses, is a PCA based approach with automatic determination of the number of factors to use. This is mainly inspired by a recent benchmark from Jessica Li's group [[cf. Zhou et al., Genome Biology, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02761-4)]. Please note that additional considerations should be taken for single-cell eQTL analysis as investigated by [[cf. Xue et al., Genome Biology, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-023-02873-5)].
#### QTL Association Testing (Step 4)
##### A.  QTL Association Analysis


We perform QTL association testing using TensorQTL [[cf. Taylor-Weiner et al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1836-7)].
