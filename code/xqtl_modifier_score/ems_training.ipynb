    "\n",
    "Traditional genetic studies only explain 5% of Alzheimer's disease heritability. The remaining 95% \"missing heritability\" occurs because bulk tissue approaches cannot capture regulatory effects that occur in specific cell types. Our machine learning approach identifies genetic variants that affect gene expression specifically in brain cell types like microglia, potentially explaining previously undetected disease mechanisms.\n",

    "- **Testing variants**: 761 genetic variants from chromosome 2 (non-overlapping)\n",
    "- **Feature dimensions**: 4,839 genomic annotations per variant\n",
    "- **Target prediction**: Binary classification (functional vs. non-functional eQTLs)\n",
    "  \n",
    "**What makes this a \"toy\" dataset:**\n",
    "- We use a smaller, simpler version of the full research study\n",
    "- The full study used all 22 chromosomes with thousands of people\n",
    "- Our tutorial uses only chromosome 2 data from a smaller sample\n",
